Added some helper files.
The helper folder contains json and scripts to help manual testing.
Start application. Then:

Run ./helper/manual_test_01.sh (make sure proper permission is set) to go through application as authorized user.
These should be successful.

Run ./helper/manual_test_02.sh (make sure proper permission is set) to go through application without authorization.
These should all display 'forbidden' error message.
